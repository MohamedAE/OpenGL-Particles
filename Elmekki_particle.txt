"Fountain of Colours"

A variation of the "Warp Speed" particle effect.

This effect simulates a fountain of coloured particles initially moving upwards,
and are subject to gravity throughout their lifespan. The appearance of depth
was simulated by starting each particle with a low alpha, and incrementing it
slightly when the particle is redrawn. When the particle reaches the boundary of
the window, it is reinitialized, essentially creating an infinite loop with the
given number of particles. Pressing the space bar will add more particles.

*Initial window size was increased to 600x600
*Initial FPS was increased to 60fps

Initial configuration
    - 50 particles
    - Randomized colours
    - A low alpha value
    - Point of origin at bottom-center of window
    - Direction vector
        A slight x-direction (positive and negative)
        A moderate y-direction (positive)
    - Speed vector
        - A slight x-direction (to keep particles from reaching lateral
            boundaries too quickly)
        - A moderate y-direction

Effect of update function
    - Alpha incremented slightly
    - X and Y position is incremented slightly (based on speed and direction
        vectors)
    - The Y value of the direction vector is decremented slightly, to simulate
        gravity
